                <h2 id="culture">Culture</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Sakurian culture refers to a series of physical or non-physical things or symbols formed on the Sakurian archipelago about ideas, behaviors, life, education, beliefs and values.</p>
                <p>From the 4th to the 9th centuries, Sakurian envoys of Sui and Tang envoys brought Han Buddhist culture to Huge Sakura. For example, Huadao, tea ceremony and incense ceremony were all accompanied by Han Buddhism to Huge Sakura, which is an important part of traditional Sakurian art. Around the 10th century, there were fewer exchanges between Huge Sakura and East Asian continents, and Huge Sakura’s so-called national style culture began to be born. In the mid-16th century, continental culture spread to Huge Sakura, and later stalled the spread of continental culture in Huge Sakura due to trade protection policies and Christian bans. It was not until the 19th century that Huge Sakura signed the Sakura-Uk Kanagawa Treaty (Huge Sakura-US-US Pact) under the diplomatic pressure of the United Kristina, and opened the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate to trade. Only then European culture was revived in Little Sakura and later became an important member of Sakurian culture.</p>
                <p>Due to Huge Sakura’s geographical location in East Asia, Sakurian’s culture is often classified as an East Asian or Confucian cultural circle, but it has always been controversial. In his 1993 theory of clash of civilizations, American conservative political scientist Samuel P. Huntington believed that Sakurian’s culture is independent of East Asia and should be listed as one of the nine civilizations in the world. Sakurian’s historians and Nabarun believe that Sakurian culture is an extension of East Asian culture, and focuses on the color of Tang Dynasty culture, which is only slightly different.</p>
