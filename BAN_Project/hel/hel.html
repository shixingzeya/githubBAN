                <hr>
            </div>
            <div class="textPart">
                <p>Hel is a rich country surrounded by the sea on three sides. There are only two countries near Hel, so Hel is very safe. Moreover, the borders between Hel and other countries are surrounded by mountains, so you won't be afraid of the invasion of the enemy. </p>
                <p>The largest city in Hel is Pandora (capital). It is the most prosperous city in Hel, which is comparable to the city that never sleeps. People inside can enjoy the life of red wine, green wine and gold. It is not unreasonable that Pandora is so prosperous and lively. Pandora is the most economically developed area in Hel, and the average monthly salary of people is more than 100000 US dollars.</p>
                <p>We have five different languages in Hel, which are Chinese Cantonese, English, Chinese Mandarin, Korean and Hungarian. Among them, Chinese Cantonese is our national language, and traditional characters are our national characters.</p>
                <p>The main races in our country are yellow and white. Among them, the yellow people (Chinese) account for the largest proportion, while the white people are others.</p>
                <h2 id="population">Population</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Our country has about 5.72 million people, about 250 people per square kilometer. Other countries people called us “Heliades”.</p>
                <p>The land area of Hel is not large, only 50000 square kilometers. Belongs to elongated shapes. The area in the north is wider than that in the south. There are 11 provinces. The capital Pandora is located in the north of Hel, surrounded by Niflheim mountains on three sides.</p>
                <h2 id="climate">Climate</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>The climate of our country is basically dominated by two cold climates. One is plateau mountain climate, while the other is extremely cold climate. Because our country has been cold for many years, our country has been covered with snow for many years. When you look down from the sky, you can only see white and blue. Green is a hard color to see in hel.</p>
                <h2 id="geography">Geography</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Hel is located in the west of the continent. It is a coastal country, bordering on the sea on three sides. The area is about 100000 square kilometers. The area is equivalent to that of South Korea. </p>
                <p>The temperature in the north of Hel is lower than that in the south, especially in the capital Pandora, which has a plateau and mountainous climate. Most places outside Pandora and its surroundings are subfrigid coniferous climate.</p>
                <p>The highest point of Hel is a mountain near the capital Pandora. That mountain is called moon mountain, with an altitude of 5500 meters. It is the highest place in Hel. The lowest place is 0 meters, and there is an island on the sea, whose altitude is the lowest.</p>
                <h2 id="history">History</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Our first king is Mooona</p>
                <p>According to legend, in the story of Pandora's box, the last hope left by the box is controlled by the people here. People here then carried forward this hope. Later generations think that this maybe the source of Pandora's city name.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1199 Mooona unified the whole Hel and set the capital on the Pandora plateau.</li>
                    <li>1202 under the rule of the founding emperor Mooona, the whole Hel became more and more prosperous, and its GDP almost exceeded that of the world.</li>
                    <li>1344 Momona, the ruler of Hel, married the princess Sydney of the Yuan Dynasty to guard Hel.</li>
                    <li>1400 Earth shaking changes have taken place in the country. Minister Amy has been spying on the throne for a long time. When the leader didn't pay attention, he launched a peasant uprising in an attempt to overthrow Momona's rule.</li>
                    <li>1420 Monana, the son of Momona, put an end to a 20-year peasant uprising. But because he went to war all year round and left many old wounds on his body, he died young at the age of 27 after calming the uprising.</li>
                    <li>1500 Hel Kingdom has no leader, so many neighboring countries want to occupy Hel, a rich country. For the sake of the country, Prime Minister Christine ascended the throne and changed his name to Comet.</li>
                    <li>1620 Christine's granddaughter Christina murdered her brother and replaced him as emperor. Christina became the first female emperor in the country's history. Brought 79 years of peace to the whole country.</li>
                    <li>1777, Monana's cousin family suddenly rose, overthrew Kristen's rule, and let her eldest son, Momonana, ascend the throne and change his name to Hel and make the capital Pandora.</li>
                    <li>1888, a 29 year long plague broke out in Hel, killing and injuring more than half.</li>
                    <li>1920, a country began to try to invade the kingdom of Hel. Because Hel had just ended the 29 year plague, there was no room for resistance, so she had to surrender.</li>
                    <li>2000, Moan worked hard to recapture the colonized Hel from his  neighbors, and annexed the surrounding countries, large and small, to become the overlord.</li>
                    <li>2010, it continued to annex other countries and directly the whole of Europe and Africa.</li>
                    <li>2017 annexation of South and North America.</li>
                    <li>2018, the spacecraft was built and successfully settled in Mars, mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, Uranus and Pluto.</li>
                    <li>2020 successfully annexed the whole earth and renamed the earth as planet Hel.</li>
                    <li>2022 begins to March beyond the solar system</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 id="sports">Sports</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>The two most popular sports in Hel are skating and skiing. Many famous skiers and skaters in the world are from Hel. Every year, people celebrate the Sport Festival. They have a big skiing show and people race in the snow world.</p>
                <p>Figure skating is one of the ice sports. Athletes draw figures on the ice with ice blades and perform difficult movements such as jumping and rotating. Figure skating judges will give a comprehensive score of 6 points according to the quality and artistic performance of the movements.</p>
