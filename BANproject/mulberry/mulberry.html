Mulberry is a developed country with a small population of about 100,000 people. The terrain and climate of Mulberry land are complex and diverse, and the biodiversity is complete, which is the main home of a variety of wild plants and animals.</p>
                <h2 id="history">History</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>In 7000 BC, the ecological conditions of the area north of Mulberry were favorable for human habitation, which led to strong population growth in the area during this period. Mulberry archaeological discovery before 2000 BC. The Mulberry Basin has been inhabited by agricultural people for more than 2,000 years. This region has long been the center of civilized activity. According to excavated artifacts and oral history records, the earliest of these civilizations was a farming civilization. After the 16th century, the emergence of a rival kingdom of Bajimir and Vadai kingdom, from the three wars endless. Except for the slave raids, none of these regimes extended their control to the grasslands of the south. It was unified from 1883 to 1899.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>The mulberry tree is surrounded by four countries. It has no contact with the sea, no coastline and is inland. Mulberry is the largest country in the world, with an area of 6.5 million square kilometers, about the size of China on Earth. To the west of Mulberry there is a very scary mountain range called Devil's Hill, it is the biggest mountain in the world . Occupying the entire west side of Mulberry, it is sepulchingly neglected, ecologically sound and rich in natural resources. Mulberry attached great importance to agricultural development, so they reclaimed many areas, most of which were farmland, so the terrain was flat. Of course, mulberry, as the home of the environmental protection group, is very environmentally protected, and many rare creatures live here.</p>
                <h2 id="climate">Climate</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Mulberry is mainly temperate. It is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean on three sides and is located in the milder southern hemisphere. The average elevation in the equator and inland is higher. Due to the influence of the topography and oceans, Mulberry has different climates in different places.</p>
                <p>Mulberry has a desert in the northwest, with a subtropical climate in the east, along the border and the Indian Ocean. From the east, the land quickly crossed the mountains to the back plateau, which is called the plateau. Although Mulberry is a semi-arid area, there are differences in climate and topography.</p>
                <p>The climate in the southwest is similar to that of the Mediterranean region, with mild and humid winters and hot and dry summers. Most of Mulberry's wine is also produced in this area. This area is also famous for its wind, almost all year round. The wind is sometimes strong, which is bad for sailors, causing many ships to crash. Further east of the southern coast, the rainfall is more even throughout the year, forming a green landscape.</p>

Although the mulberry food is very popular, the food is not the only thing, we also have lots of dancing and music.</p>
                <p>Because we are very homogeneous, our cultural traditions are the most deeply rooted.
