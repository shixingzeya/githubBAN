            <p>It is high near the sea, and in the middle is a basin, with a big river running through the east and west, which is the hinge of our communication between the east and the west. Relying on this big river, we have saved much time and money.</p>
            <p>And at either end of the river we have two bays, which are our doors to export and to import.</p>
            <p>There is a high mountain with a pickle monument on the top. This high mountain is our highest main peak. It will have snow in winter, but the mountain environment will have different views in spring and summer. There is a river, which runs north and south, and at the end of both ends, there are two pickle monuments.</p>
            <p>Starting from Mount Kimchi in the north and running across the east coast is the longest mountain range of Little Kimchi, with a length of about 500 kilometers and an average elevation of 1,000 meters, forming the backbone of the southern mountain range. Due to the erosion of the east Sea waves, the eastern slope of kimchi Mountain is a cliff and rocky islets, while the western slope and southern slope are relatively gentle, forming plains and many offshore islands and small bays.</p>
