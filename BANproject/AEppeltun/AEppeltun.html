                <p>Æppeltún has only one mono-ethnic race living on this mountain for 100,000 years, and Æppeltún’s food is the most popular in the world. Because of the agricultural technology here, the ingredients of Æppeltún are perfect. The food produced does not need to be overprocessed to be delicious enough. Basically, all tourists who come to Æppeltún come for food and the superior natural environment of Æppeltún.</p>
                <p>Because Æppeltún is mainly a vegetarian (meat is sold abroad, and the residents of Æppeltún love nature), the annual ”food sharing meeting with monkeys“ has been derived. The food sharing meeting with monkeys was held around the Epimethus Center ”hello monkey“ area.</p>
                <p>Our traditional dress is the Dongbei cotton-padded jacket (worn by the first emperor Shangguan Fugui). </p>
                <p>Æppeltún is the only country in the Himalayas.</p>
                <p>Æppeltún has no class bourgeois concept. Most people live an ordinary life of occasionally traveling, raising chickens and ducks. Because the land is vast and sparsely populated, with an average of 3.6 square kilometers of land per person, no one competes for or robs people.</p>
                <p>Æppeltún‘s educational resources are not excellent, and they are basically related agriculture. However, this is also the fundamental reason why Æppeltún became an agricultural power. </p>
                <h3>Religion</h3>
                <p> Æppeltún believes in only one religion, that is, "wisdom". Because Æppeltúnians firmly believe that only wisdom can lead the world to a better future. Most Æppeltúnians love freedom. It happens that wisdom can get out of the cage and have freedom, so "wisdom" lasts for a long time in Æppeltún.</p>
                <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>The most Æppeltúnians have to learn is about agricultural. This is also one of the reasons for the development of Æppeltún agriculture.</p>

                <p>Æppeltún's military strength is top.

Every Æppeltúnians is a resolute anti-warist.</p>
